  <p class="introduction">
    From a young age, I found that having an artistic outlet was the perfect way
    to express my thoughts, creativity, and imagination. I fell in love with
    filmmaking through writing scripts and operating a YouTube channel, studying
    cinematography at a pre-military college with an emphasis on directing, and
    intensive editing in the IDF.

  <p class="introduction" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
    My goal in every project, from editing a short video and image shoots to a
    full-length film, is to create an emotional experience for the viewer,
    whether it is a dramatic and exciting atmosphere and whether it is a light
    and humorous content, according to the client's wishes.
